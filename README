SYNOPSIS
    Provides a few helpers to ease the use of Redis in your Mojolicious
    application.

            use Mojolicious::Plugin::Redis
        
            sub startup {
              my $self = shift;
                
              $self->plugin('redis', { 
                      server => 'localhost:6379',
                      debug => 0,
                      encoding => undef, # Disable the automatic utf8 encoding => much more performance
                      helper => 'db'
                    });
            }

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
        helper      (optional)  The name to give to the easy-access helper if you want to change it's name from the default
        no_helper   (optional)  When set to true, no helper will be installed.

    All other options passed to the plugin are used to connect to Redis. In
    other words ANY option can be sended to Redis module.

HELPERS/ATTRIBUTES
  redis_connection
    This plugin attribute holds the Redis::Connection object, use this if
    you need to access it for some reason.

  db
    This helper will return the database handler. If you have renamed the
    helper, use that name instead of 'db' in the example below :)

        sub someaction {
          my $self = shift;
          
              # ping Redis server
              $self->db->PING();
          
              # get value of 'foo' named key
              $self->db->GET('foo');

        }
